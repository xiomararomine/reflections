What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new git repository with all the related files from that folder/directory. You just need to be inside the directory you want to inialize and thn run "git init".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area just holds one, some or all the files temporarily unlike the working directory/repository which contains all of the files. The staging area allows the user to arrange, organize and/or revise files before committing.
