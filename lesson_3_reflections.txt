When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository is a good idea if you want to have files you can access from anywhere, if you want to be able to use different computers to work on a project, if you want to be able to share files with others and/or if you want other users to be able to work on the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you have control over what gets pulled. You may want to keep your local version clean of experimental branches and/or files contributed by other users.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when you want to copy a file in Github but still give the original creator credit and link back to the original file. This will put a copy in your Github account where you can then move it to your computer and edit it and/or add contributors. Clones are where you can make a copy of the files local, in Github or from Github to/from local. It just basically makes a copy. Branches are just the history of commits and/or changes made to a file (commits) that branch off the master.
