When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository is a good idea if you want to have files you can access from anywhere, if you want to be able to use different computers to work on a project, if you want to be able to share files with others and/or if you want other users to be able to work on the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you have control over what gets pulled. You may want to keep your local version clean of experimental branches and/or files contributed by other users.
